# Submission Checklist:
## Semantically correct HTML structure.

The HTML document demonstrates proper semantic structure using HTML5 semantic elements:

**Document Structure:**
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration with proper `<html lang="en">` attribute
- Well-organized `<head>` section with comprehensive meta tags
- Semantic body layout using `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` elements

**Semantic Elements Used:**
- `<header>` - Contains personal information, name, title, and contact details
- `<main>` - Wraps all primary content sections
- `<section>` - Organizes content into logical groups (education, skills, experience)
- `<article>` - Represents individual entries within sections (education entry, job positions)
- `<address>` - Properly marks up contact information
- `<time>` - Semantically represents date ranges for education and work experience
- `<footer>` - Contains social media links and external references

**Heading Hierarchy:**
- Proper heading structure: `<h1>` for main title, `<h2>` for section headings, `<h3>` for subsection titles
- Logical content flow and accessibility compliance

**Accessibility Features:**
- Semantic markup improves screen reader navigation
- Proper use of `<address>` for contact information
- `<time>` elements enhance date recognition for assistive technologies

This semantic structure provides clear content organization, improves SEO, and ensures accessibility compliance while maintaining clean, maintainable code.

**Layout Structure:**

   - Uses `<article>` elements for individual education entries
   - Includes school name, location, degree, and time periods using semantic `<time>` elements
   - Provides space for academic achievements and activities

2. **Skills Section** (`<section id="skills">`)
   - Showcases technical and professional competencies
   - Lists relevant skills including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and design tools
   - Organized as readable paragraph format for easy scanning
